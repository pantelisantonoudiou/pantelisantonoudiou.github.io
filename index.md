## Background

I am a research scientist at Tufts University with a focus on Neuroscience and recently AI interpretability. My contributions in neuroscience center on how dynamic neural states arise and guide behavior, and how their disruption contributes to affective and neurological disorders.

I earned my PhD in the [Mann Lab](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/research/mann-group) at the University of Oxford, where I studied how interneurons contribute to hippocampal gamma oscillations. I then moved to Boston for postdoctoral research in the [Maguire Lab](https://www.maguirelab.com/) at Tufts, investigating how neural dynamics in the amygdala shape emotional behaviors.

## Interests

I am deeply interested in how biological and artificial systems process information, with a focus on the computational principles that underlie cognition and brain dynamics.

I also enjoy writing code to analyze multi-modal data, extract meaningful insights from data, and build tools that support transparent and interpretable science.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring how deep learning models like CNNs classify EEG signals, aiming to uncover the neuronal mechanisms behind their decisions.
