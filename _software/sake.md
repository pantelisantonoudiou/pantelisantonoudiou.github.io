## 🧠 What is SAKE?

**SAKE** is a Python-based GUI for organizing, processing, and analyzing EEG/LFP recordings from Labchart (ADInstruments).

SAKE provides a structured data pipeline, helping researchers organize, curate, and analyze large volumes of EEG data quickly and reproducibly.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- SAKE-plan (Create an organized map across EEG files).
- SAKE-plot (Perform spectral analysis (STFT), outlier detection, noise removal, manual curation, and summary plots).
- SAKE-connectivity (Perform coherence and cross-frequency connectivity analyses).

---

## 💡 Why We Built It
Instead of rebuilding analysis tools for every project, we created SAKE to serve as a **reusable backbone**, helping users organize their files and apply consistent analysis methods, especially for long-term recordings.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, PyQt
