## 🧠 What is SeizyML?

**SeizyML** is an open-source Python toolkit for semi-automated detection of electrographic seizures. It combines simple, interpretable machine learning models with manual validation resulting in high accuracy and sensitivity, reducing bias, saving time, and improving reproducibility.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Fully open-source and built in Python.
- GUI for manual curation of detected seizures.
- Requires minimal training data to get started.
- Lightweight (Just a standard CPU and enough memory).

## 💡 Why I Built It

Despite many seizure-related studies, there was no accessible tool to help researchers automate seizure detection from raw LFP/EEG data. SeizyML fills that gap by offering a validated, easy-to-use pipeline designed to **augment** human expertise.

---

## 📊 Validation

We tested SeizyML on extensive EEG data from chronically epileptic mice. The **Gaussian Naive Bayes** model detected **all seizures**, had the **lowest false detection rate**, and required only a small training set.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib.
