# Personal Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal website https://pantelisantonoudiou.github.io/.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that turns Markdown files into a full website. It uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme for layout and styling, and is version-controlled through GitHub. The site is then automatically deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
